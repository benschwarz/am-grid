# am-Grid

This project is:

## Made with flexbox
- No weird floats
- Vertical alignment is trivial
- Horizontal alignment is trivial

## Browser support

am-grid is built using autoprefixer, which is configured to include css vendor prefixes that cover the last two editions of all browsers. 

<table width="100%" style="text-align: center;">

      <td>100% rad</td>
